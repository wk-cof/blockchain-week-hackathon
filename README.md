## General Info
To get money it costs a lot of time and money to travel to get
Need to get imagination going, not only this country that is living in these conditions
Not only blockchain, IOT, drones etc “do your worst” come and talk, help us, help you.
If you can solve for PNG it will work in other countries that are similar

## How does the economy of the local store work, could each store be the central point
Yes

## Do they go to the village store to get loans
NOT YET you can to build it

## How do you get the word out to the people?
Asked if ok to screen a movie for the children, then people came from ALL around.  So it is possible to “spread the word” by some form of “event”

## To what extent has the application been used?
1st was ID system, now have energy trading, voting system and remittance so you can send money.  You can use the API to build applications on top of it.  Can see if they are on the system

## What is the coverage of ID box
For now is working prototype and proof of concept, one in PNG, South America, Africa.  Doing POC first before raising mass money, baby steps.

## What is your approach to the culture
Do consensus working in the village.  When working in certain villages you are not allow to say your own name because of bad spirits, so made it harder, people had to name each other.

### Access to people and cooperation is not a problem, very hospitable.

In the Indonesian portion of Papau, want to find out why teachers weren’t coming back to school to teach.  It was because there was no access to bank, they would need to travel to capital.  Take days and take half years salary.  So they stayed in the capital to make money before going back to the villages, otherwise cost too much.  Public service wages in rural areas is a great use case.
